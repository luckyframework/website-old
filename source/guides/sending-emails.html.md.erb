order: 14
intro: >
  Carbon is a type safe way to create, send, and test emails. It is adapter
  based so you can use any service you want.

# Configuring Carbon

Lucky generates default configuration in `config/email.cr`. In that file you
can add SendGrid keys and change adapters.

# Sending and testing emails

See the README at https://github.com/luckyframework/carbon

You can also check out the `PasswordResetEmail` in the `src/emails` directory
of a newly generated project.
