order: 1
intro: >
  Learn how to install Crystal, Lucky, and the required dependencies. Lucky
  works on macOS and Linux machines. A few dependencies are required before
  getting started.
---

## Install Required Dependencies

To get Lucky, you need to install these first.

* Install one of these process managers: [Overmind (recommended)](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind#installation),
  [Heroku CLI (great if you plan to use Heroku to deploy)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install),
  [forego](https://github.com/ddollar/forego#installation),
  or [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman#installation).
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Requires at least v6
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
* [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/). Requires at least v0.25
* Postgres ([macOS](https://postgresapp.com)/[Others](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides))
* Necessary libraries: On Debian (Ubuntu should be similar) run "apt-get install libc6-dev libevent-dev libpcre2-dev libssl1.0-dev libyaml-dev zlib1g-dev"

## Install Lucky

Once the required dependencies are installed, set up Lucky for your system.

### On macOS

* Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* Run `brew install openssl` to make sure you have OpenSSL
* Run `brew tap luckyframework/homebrew-lucky`
* Run `brew install lucky`
* Make sure [Postgres CLI tools](https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html)
  are installed if you're using Postgres.app
* If you are on macOS High Sierra you need to add `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig`
to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`

> If you get an error like this: `Package libssl/libcrypto was not found in the
pkg-config search path` then be sure to run the last step listed above so that
Crystal knows where OpenSSL is located.

### On Linux

* `git clone` the CLI repo at https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky_cli
* cd into the newly cloned directory
* Check out latest [released version](https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky_cli/releases) `git checkout v0.11.0`
* Run `shards install`
* Run `crystal build src/lucky.cr --release --no-debug`
* Move the generated `lucky` binary to your path. Most of the time you can move
  it to `/usr/local/bin` and it should work.

## Start a New Project

To start a new project, run `lucky init {project_name}`.

So if you wanted to start a new app for your blog you might do:

```
lucky init my_blog
```

## Running a Lucky Project

To start the server and run your project, first change into the directory for your
newly created app with `cd {project_name}`. Then run `bin/setup` to install dependencies
and `lucky dev` to start the server.

Running `lucky dev` will use an installed process manager (Overmind, Foreman,
etc.) to start the processes defined in `Procfile.dev`. By default
`Procfile.dev` will start the lucky server, and will start asset compilation.

> Lucky will look for a number of process managers. So if you prefer Forego
and someone else on your team prefers to use Overmind, `lucky dev` will work
for both of you.
