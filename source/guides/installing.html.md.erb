  Learn how to install Crystal, Lucky, and the required dependencies. Lucky
  works on macOS and Linux machines. A few dependencies are required before
  getting started.

## Install Required Dependencies

To get Lucky, you need to install these first

* Heroku CLI (later Lucky will support foreman, and forego as well)
* Node
* Yarn
* Crystal
* Postgres

## Install Lucky

Once the required dependencies are installed, set up Lucky for your system

## On macOS:

Make sure you have home-brew, then run `brew install lucky`

## On Linux machines:

* Do a bunch of other crap

## Start a New Project

To start a new project, run `lucky init {project_name}`.

So if you wanted to start a new app for your blog you might do:

```
lucky init my_blog
```

## Running a Lucky Project

To start the server and run your project, first change into the directory for your
newly created app with `cd {project_name}`. Then run `lucky dev`.

Running `lucky dev` will use the Heroku CLI to start the processes defined in `Procfile.dev`.
By default `Procfile.dev` will start the lucky server, and will start Brunch to compile assets.
