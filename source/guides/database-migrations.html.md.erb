title: Setting Up &amp; Migrating the Database
order: 6
intro: >
  Lucky can help drop the database, create the database, and manage creating and
  altering tables using migrations.
---

## Create or drop the database

First you’ll need to create a database using `lucky db.create`

> The database name and settings can be changed in `config/database.cr`

You can drop the database by calling `lucky db.drop`

## Generating a new migration

When you want to add or modify the database you can create a new migration using `lucky gen.migration {migration_name}`

For example:

`lucky gen.migration CreateUsers` or `lucky gen.migration AddAgeToUsers`

## Creating and altering tables

```crystal
# created_at, updated_at, and id are added automatically
create :users do
  add name : String # will set the column to NULL FALSE
  add age : Int32? # will allow NULL values because of the nilable type
end
```

### Altering a table

```crystal
alter :users do
  add phone : String
  remove :age

  # Sometimes you need things that LuckyMigrator doesn't support
  execute "custom SQL"
end
```

## Custom SQL

Lucky only has methods for a small set of possible changes you can make to your tables.

For things Lucky doesn't support, you can use `execute` to run any sql you want.

## Running and rolling back migrations

`lucky db.migrate` and `lucky db.rollback`
