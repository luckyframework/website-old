title: Saving Data with Forms
order: 7
intro: >
  Lucky saves records to the database using objects called forms. You can use
  forms to validate, format, and save data in a type safe and flexible way.
---

> Expect forms in Lucky to change often while in alpha. We will be experimenting
a lot with different APIs to try to keep the best balance between simplicity,
maintainability, and catching bugs at compile time.

# Setting up a form

When you set up a model, a `{ModelName}::BaseForm` will be created so that you can inherit
from it and customize validations, callbacks, and what fields are allowed to be
set.

We’ll be using the migration and model from the [Querying
guide][/guides/querying-the-database.html]. Once you have that set up, let’s set
up a form:

```
# src/queries/user_form.cr
class UserForm < User::BaseForm
end
```

> You can have more than one form object to save a record in different ways. For
example, you might have a `RegistrationForm` that encrypts the user’s password
and sends them a welcome email.

## Allowing params to be saved

By default you won’t be able to set any data from params. This is a security
measure to make sure that parameters can only be set that you want to allow. For
example, you might not want your users to be able to set an admin status through
the `UserForm`.

To allow a field, use the `allow` macro:

```
# src/forms/user_form.cr
class UserForm < User::BaseForm
  allow name
end
```

Now you will be able to save the user’s name with form params.

> Actions have a `params` method that returns a `LuckyWeb::Params` object. This is
used by the form to get form params that are set by [submitting an HTML form](#using-with-html-forms).

```
# inside of an action with some form params
UserForm.save(params) do |form, user|
 if user # the user was saved
   puts "Hello #{user.name}"
 else # the user was not saved
   pp form.errors
 end
end
```

You pass a block that is run whether the save is successful or not.

You will *always* receive the form object, but you will only get the saved user
if there are no errors while saving. If there are errors, the user will be `nil`.

### Updating records

```
# inside of an action with some form params
user = UserQuery.new.first
UserForm.update(user, params) do |form, updated_user|
 # do something with the form and user
end
```

## Using with HTML forms

You can use forms in HTML like this:

> Remember: you *must* `allow` a field in order to use it in a form. If it isn’t
allowed you can't use it.

```
# src/pages/users/new_page.cr
class Users::NewPage
 needs user_form : UserForm

 render do
   render_user_form(@user_form)
 end

 private def render_user_form(f)
   form_for Users::Create do
     label_for f.name
     text_input f.name
     errors_for f.name

     submit "Save User"
   end
 end
end
```

> A private method `render_user_form` is extracted because it makes it easier to
reference the form as `f`. It also makes it easier to see what a page looks like
with a quick glance at the `render` method.

```
class Users::Create < BrowserAction
  action do
    # params will have the form params sent from the HTML form
    UserForm.save(params) do |form, user|
      if user # if the user was saved
        redirect to: Home::Index
      else
        # re-render the NewPage so the user can correct their mistakes
        render NewPage, user_form: form
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Validating data

Lucky comes with a few built in validations:

* `validate_required` - ensures that a field is not `nil` or blank (e.g. `""`).
* `validate_confirmation_of` - ensures that fields have the same values.

> Note: non-nillable (required) fields automatically use
`validate_required`. They will run after the `prepare` callback. This way data
with missing fields will never be sent to the database.

### Using validations

You can use validations inside of the `prepare` callback:

```
class UserForm < User::BaseForm
 allow name

 def prepare
   validate_required name
 end
end
```

The `prepare` method is called when you call `valid?` on the form or when you
try to `save` or `update` it.

## What are fields?

First you’ll need to know that the fields defined in the form do not return the
value of the field. They return a `LuckyRecord::Field` that contains the value
of the field, the name of the field, the param value, and any errors the field
has.

This means that to access their value you must call `value` on the field.

```
class UserForm < User::BaseForm
 def prepare
   pp name.value
 end
end
```

## Custom validations

You can easily create our own validations. For example, let’s say we want to
make sure the user is old enough to use the site.

```
def prepare
  validate_is_old_enough age
end

private def user_is_old_enough(field)
  # The value might be `nil` so we need to use `try`.
  field.value.try do |value|
    if value < 13
      field.add_error "must be at least 13 to use this site"
    end
  end
end
```

## Callbacks

> Callbacks often get a bad rap because they can quickly lead to hard to
maintain code. One reason for this is situations arrive when you want callbacks
to run only in certain conditions. In Lucky this is situation is quickly solved
by adding a new form. For example you might have a `SignUpForm` for a `User`
that encrypts the users password and sends a welcome email after saving. Or you
might have an `AdminUserForm` that saves a user and sends an admin specific
email.

You can use the following callbacks:

* `prepare`
* `before_save`
* `after_save(record : T)`

To use them, define a method in the form. Note that the `after_save`
callback needs to accept the newly created record. In this example, a `User`.

```
class UserForm < User::BaseForm
  def after_save(newly_saved_user : User)
    # do something with the user
  end
end
```

## Passing extra data to forms

Sometimes you need to pass extra data to forms that aren't in the form params.
For example you might want to pass the currently signed in user so that you know
who created a record. Here's how you do this:

```
# This is a great way to pass in an associated record
needs created_by : User
```

This will make it so that you must pass in `created_by` when saving or updating
the `TaskForm`. It will make a getter available for `created_by` so you can use
it in the form

Here's how you might use the `created_by` value.

```
def prepare
  created_by_id.value = created_by.id
end
```

## Saving forms without a params object

> This will be improved soon. Right now there is very little type safety when
creating forms this way.

This can be helpful if you’re saving something that doesn’t need an HTML form,
like if you only need the params passed in the path.

```
UserForm.new(name: "Paul").save

# for updates
UserForm.new(existing_user, name: "David").update
```

## Sharing common validations, callbacks, etc.

When using multiple forms for one model you often want to share a common set of
validations, allowances, etc.

You can do this with a module:

```
# src/forms/mixins/user_form_defaults
module UserFormDefaults
 macro included
   allow name, age, email
 end

 def prepare
   validate_old_enough_to_use_website
 end
end
```

Then in your form:

```
# src/forms/admin_user_form.cr
class AdminUserForm < User::BaseForm
 include UserFormDefaults
 allow work_email

 def prepare
   super
   admin.value = true
 end
end
```

## Ideas for naming

In Lucky it is common to have multiple forms per model. This makes it easier to
understand what a form does and makes them easier to change later without
breaking other flows.

Here are some ideas for naming:

* `Csv{ModelName}Form` - great for forms that get data from a CSV. e.g. `CsvUserImportForm`
* `SignUpForm` - for signing up a new user. Encrypt passwords, send welcom eemails, etc.
* `SignInForm` - check that passwords match
* `Admin{ModelName}Form` - sometimes admin can set more fields than a regular user. It’s
  often a good idea to extract a new form for those cases.
