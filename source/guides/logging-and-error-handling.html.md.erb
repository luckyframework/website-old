title: Logging and Error Handling
order: 11
intro: >
  Logging your data and handling errors are two very important parts to developing your app.
  Lucky allows you to customize your log output, as well as choose how you want to handle your errors.
---

## Logging

By default, Lucky formats the log output to look like `GET 200 / TIMESTAMP (27.0µs)`. This is broken down in to several parts:

* The HTTP request method
* The HTTP server status
* The requested route
* The current timestamp of the request (by default only in production)
* and the elapsed time

## Logger Options

### show_timestamps : Bool
Show/Hide the current timestamp of the request. By default this is shown only in production

### log_formatter : Lucky::LogFormatters::Base
Customize how your log is formatted, and what information it shows. By default this is the `DefaultLogFormatter`

### enabled : Bool
An option to turn on/off logging. By default this is set to true.

## Log Formatters

To customize your logging output, you can create a custom Log Formatter. Open your `config/log_handler.cr` file to add this option:

```crystal
Lucky::LogHandler.configure do |settings|
  settings.show_timestamps = Lucky::Env.production?
  settings.log_formatter = MyCustomFormatter.new
end
```

> Note: Be sure to require this new formatter in your stack. I suggest in `src/dependencies.cr`

The structure for the formatters is a class that inherits from `Lucky::LogFormatters::Base` and defines the `format(context, time, elapsed) : String` method. Take a look at this example:

```crystal
class MyCustomFormatter < Lucky::LogFormatters::Base
  def format(context, time, elapsed)
    case context.response.status_code
    when 200..399
      "😁"
    when 400..499
      "😱"
    when 500..599
      "😭"
    else
      "🧐"
    end
  end
end
```

This method gives you access to the current `context : HTTP::Server::Context` which contains the `request` and `response` objects, `time : Time` which is the current timestamp, and `elapsed : Time::Span` which is the amount of time the entire request took to complete.

Lucky has 3 helper methods you can use for some helpful formatting as well.

```crystal
# Returns the status_code colorized with green, yellow, or red text based on the range of the code
colored_status_code(context.response.status_code)

# Formats the time to ISO_8601_DATE_TIME if the `show_timestamps` option is set to true.
timestamp(time)

# Does some fancy math to display the elapsed span in a human readable format
elapsed_text(elapsed)
```

## Error Handling

When an exception is thrown in your code, you don't want your user left with a blank page, so Lucky has a built in way of handling these errors.

When in development, Lucky uses the [ExceptionPage](https://github.com/crystal-loot/exception_page) shard to display a helpful page with your stack trace, and exception message. The option to display the error page or not is in `config/error_handler.cr`.

## Custom Error Responses

When building your application, you may create your own custom exception classes. In this case, you may want to have a way to handle how your app responds to those specifically.

If you need to return a special http status code based on an error, for example: return 401 after throwing a `NotAuthorizedError`, you can do this.

```crystal
# define your custom exception
class NotAuthorizedError < Exception
  include Lucky::HttpRespondable

  def http_error_code
    403
  end
end
```

Then in your action where you would throw this error:

```crystal
class SpecialAction < BrowserAction
  get "/special" do
    raise NotAuthorizedError.new
  end
end
```

## Error Reporting

There's many different services out there where you can ship your exceptions off to for better cataloging and searching of the errors.

In your `src/actions/errors/show.cr` file, there are several different `handle_error` methods. When an exception occurs in one of your actions, the appropriate method is called passing in the exception. This gives you a chance to grab that and pass it on. You can also create your own override if you want to report specifically on a custom error.

```crystal
def handle_error(error : MyCustomError)
  ErrorReporter.report(context, error)
  render Errors::ShowPage, status: 500, title: "Oops!"
end
```
